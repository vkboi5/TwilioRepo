# Population

Understanding the scale and impact of hearing loss is essential for developing effective assistive technologies.
This section outlines the global scope and significance of hearing loss and deafness.

1. **1.5 billion people** experience hearing loss globally.
2. **430 million people** require rehabilitation for disabling hearing loss.
3. **70 million people** are considered deaf.
4. **12[^ecml]-24[^derivation]-25[^sheets] million people** primarily use sign languages.

### Hearing Loss[^who]

The **World Health Organization (WHO)** estimates that globally, **1.5 billion people** live with some degree of hearing loss, a number expected to rise to **2.5 billion by 2050**. This increase is driven by factors such as population aging, unsafe listening habits, limited access to care, preventable causes going untreated, and insufficient early screening.
Of these, **430 million people** experience disabling hearing loss, requiring rehabilitation to improve quality of life.
By 2050, this number is projected to grow to **700 million**.

:::info Quote: Relevance ([learn more](../market#economic-impact))
The WHO estimates that unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of US$ 980 billion.
This figure includes health sector costs (excluding hearing devices), educational support, loss of productivity, and broader societal costs.

These impairments are defined per ear, as follows[^who-report]:

| **Grade**                                     | **Hearing Loss (dB)** | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0: No impairment**                          | 0–25 dB               | Normal hearing or no significant hearing difficulty.                                                                 |
| **1: Slight impairment**                      | 26–40 dB              | Able to hear and repeat words spoken in normal voice at 1 meter; may have difficulty in noisy settings.              |
| **2: Moderate impairment**                    | 41–60 dB              | Able to hear and repeat words spoken in raised voice at 1 meter; struggles with conversation.                        |
| **3: Severe impairment**                      | 61–80 dB              | Able to hear some words when shouted directly into the ear; significant communication challenges.                    |
| **4: Profound impairment including deafness** | >80 dB                | Unable to hear and understand even when shouted directly into the ear; often relies on visual communication methods. |

### Deafness[^wfd]

Among those with disabling hearing loss, the **World Federation of the Deaf (WFD)** estimates there are approximately **70 million deaf people worldwide**.
This community spans over **200 sign languages** (or over _300_[^un-national-day]), underlining the linguistic diversity of deaf populations.

[^wfd]: World Federation of the Deaf. 2024. [Our Work](https://wfdeaf.org/our-work/).

[^un-national-day]: United Nations. 2024. [International Day of Sign Languages](https://www.un.org/en/observances/sign-languages-day).

From our research, it is unclear how many people use sign languages.
The European Centre for Modern Languages[^ecml] estimates that on average,
deaf sign language users make up about 0.16% of the whole population in any given country, amounting to 12 million people worldwide.
According to Ethnologue (via Derivation[^derivation]), there are 24 million native sign language users worldwide,
and according to a conglomeration of sources[^sheets], the number signers for the top 100 used sign languages is 25 million.

### Sign Language Interpreters

Sign language interpreters are a rare commodity, and are globally in shortage.
In Israel, a survey conducted among the organization's members found that 67% of interpreters refuse to attend a single-hour interpretation order.[^isl-shortage]

We list the number of interpreters in various countries below. For all countries in Europe, visit https://www.eud.eu/member-countries/.
