# The Market

To understand the market size, we flow from the global language services market to the specific sign language services market:

- The global language services market is valued at **US\$ 60.68 billion** in 2022 and is predicted to reach **US\$ 96.21 billion** by the end of 2032 (CAGR of 5.94%)[^factmr-lsm].
  - ⤷ The translation service market is valued at **US\$ 26.6 billion** in 2022[^slator] and **US\$ 41.3 billion** in 2024 (CAGR of 2.30%)[^marketresearchfuture].
    - ⤷ The size of the interpreting market in 2019 was estimated at **US\$ 7.6 billion**[^nimdzi].
      - ⤷ The global sign language interpretation services market size (including both in-person and remote) was valued at approximately **US\$ 0.7 billion** in 2023 and is projected to touch **US\$ 1.5 billion** by 2032 (CAGR of 8.5%)[^businessresearchinsights].
        This is in conflict with the estimated United States market of **US\$ 1.2 billion**[^einpresswire].

[^gallaudet]: Gallaudet University. 2022. [How Sign Language is Driving a Multi-Billion Dollar Inclusive Economy](https://gallaudet.edu/president/how-sign-language-is-driving-a-multi-billion-dollar-inclusive-economy/).

To estimate the global sign language market, we extrapolate based on trends in developed nations ranked within the top 30 of the Human Development Index[^hdi], which mirror the U.S., especially in terms of accessibility regulations and inclusivity. This includes the recently enacted European Accessibility Act[^eu-accessiblity-act], the Accessible Canada Act (2019)[^canada-act], Australia’s Disability Discrimination Act (1992)[^australia-act], among others.
The total population of these developed nations is 1.09 billion[^worldometer].
Extrapolating from the U.S. market of **US\$ 10 billion**[^gallaudet] from a population of 345.4 million[^worldometer], the global sign language market is estimated at **US\$ 31.6 billion**.

## Economic Impact[^who-report]

:::tip
All monetary values in this section are originally reported in 2015 international dollars. For 2024 equivalents, a conversion factor of **1.33** is applied.
:::

Hearing loss has a profound economic impact on individuals and society, resulting in substantial costs across multiple domains.
The **World Health Organization (WHO)** estimates that the global annual cost of unaddressed hearing loss was approximately **\$980 billion** in 2015 international dollars, which translates to **\$1.303 trillion** in 2024 values.
These costs are distributed as follows:

| **Category**           | **Description**                                                                                      | **Cost (2015)** |  **Cost (2024)** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------: | ---------------: |
| **Healthcare Sector**  | Healthcare costs for children and adults due to unaddressed hearing loss, excluding hearing devices. |   \$314 billion | \$417.62 billion |
| **Educational Sector** | Costs for educational support for children (ages 5–14) with moderate to severe hearing loss.         |    \$27 billion |  \$35.91 billion |
| **Productivity Loss**  | Losses from unemployment and early retirement among people with hearing loss.                        | \$182.5 billion | \$242.73 billion |
| **Societal Costs**     | Costs due to social isolation, communication barriers, and stigma, calculated using DALYs.           | \$456.5 billion | \$607.14 billion |
| **Total**              | Aggregate global cost of unaddressed hearing loss.                                                   |   \$980 billion | \$1.303 trillion |

## Perception and Impact

Disabled people face significantly more challenges than non-disabled people in accessing products (41.6% vs. 15.8%) and services (51.5% vs. 25.2%)[^ons].
[^ons]: Office for National Statistics. 2021. [Disabled people’s access to products and services, Great Britain: February to March 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/disabledpeoplesaccesstoproductsandservicesgreatbritain/februarytomarch2022).

National Captioning Institute research[^nci] found that 66% of viewers of captioned TV are more likely to buy a product that has a captioned commercial;
53% will actively seek out products advertised with captions; and, 35% will switch to brands that use captioned ads.

- **Proctor Gamble** established an internship program with Gallaudet University
- Recent partnerships with Gallaudet University: **Microsoft**, **Qualcomm**, **Google**, **NSA**, **IDB** (Inter-American Development Bank)
- **Zoom**, **Flipgrid**, **GoReact** are only a few examples of video-based companies which have quickly realized heeding the input of Deaf consumers is key to their business.
- **Apple** partnered with Gallaudet University to spotlight schools for the deaf, and deaf-owned businesses (https://gallaudet.edu/signing-ecosystem/)

## Market Segments in the United States

The sign language services market is segmented into various categories, including:
The entire sign language economy in 2022 in the U.S. alone is estimated to range between **US\$ 3 billion** and **US\$ 10 billion** annually.[^gallaudet]

### Early Intervention

Early intervention programs for deaf and hard-of-hearing children receive substantial funding from both federal and state sources.
In 2024, the **Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)** allocated **US$ 18.8 million** to state **Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI)** programs,
while the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** provided an additional **US$ 10.7 million** to support early hearing loss detection and family support services.[^asha-funding]

In addition to federal contributions, individual states supplement these efforts with their own funding, often ranging between **US$ 1–2 million per state**<Badge type="danger" text="Citation Needed" />, leading to an estimated total nationwide funding of **US$ 50–100 million**.
These investments support newborn hearing screenings, early intervention services, and educational resources to ensure language development for deaf and hard-of-hearing children.
