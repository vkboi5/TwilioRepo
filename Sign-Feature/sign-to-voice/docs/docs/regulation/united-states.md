# Sign Language Regulation in The United States

The **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 1990)** is a U.S. civil rights law prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities in public services, employment, transportation, and digital access.[^ada-overview]
It ensures equal opportunities and accessibility in government and private sector services, requiring accommodations such as sign language interpretation and digital accessibility.

## Government Obligations

Under **ADA Title II**, federal, state, and local governments must ensure equal access to public services for individuals with disabilities.[^ada-title-ii][^state-local-services]
This includes providing sign language interpreters, captioning, and alternative communication methods in courts, emergency services (911), public offices, and public transportation.

## Private Business Obligations

Under **ADA Title III**, most businesses open to the public, regardless of size, must provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.[^ada-title-iii]
This includes physical spaces (restaurants, hotels, theaters, retail stores, healthcare facilities, private schools) and digital spaces (websites, apps).[^ada-web-access]

Auxiliary aids and services must be provided for effective communication, especially for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.[^ada-sign-interpreters]

Simple transactions may be handled through written communication; complex situations (medical consultations, legal agreements) require qualified interpreters.
Importantly, businesses cannot pass interpreter costs to customers.[^ada-sign-interpreters]

[^ada-sign-interpreters]: ADA National Network. 2017. [ADA Quick Tips - Sign Language Interpreters](https://adata.org/factsheet/sign-language-interpreters)

## Auxiliary Aids and Services

The ADA’s **Effective Communication** requirements ensure effective interaction for people with vision, hearing, or speech disabilities with public entities (Title II) and businesses serving the public (Title III).[^ada-effective-communication][^doj-effective-communication]

Covered entities must provide auxiliary aids—qualified interpreters, captioning, assistive technologies, accessible documents—based on interaction context.
This includes Video Relay Services (VRS) and Video Remote Interpreting (VRI), adhering to specific standards.[^ada-effective-communication][^doj-effective-communication]

Entities must prioritize the requested communication method unless it creates an **undue burden** (significant difficulty/cost) or fundamentally alters the service nature.
Government decisions must be documented by officials; business assessments depend on size/resources.
Staff training is crucial for compliance.[^simbo-undue-burden]

## Legal Obligations and Enforcement under the ADA
