# Sign Language Regulation in The European Union

The **European Accessibility Act (EAA, Directive (EU) 2019/882)** is an EU directive mandating accessibility in products and services to ensure equal access for individuals with disabilities.[^eaa-directive][^eu-accessibility-laws]
Primarily targeting private-sector services, the EAA imposes limited obligations on governmental services, affecting only commercially provided public services.[^eaa-vs-ada]
Unlike regulations directly applicable across the EU, each member state must transpose the EAA into national law.[^eu-directive-vs-regulation]
Enforcement responsibilities are shared between the EU level (harmonization and oversight) and member states (national enforcement, penalties, compliance checks).[^eaa-business-disability]

## Regulated Products

The EAA mandates accessibility for critical products, including:[^eu-eaa-products]

- **Computers & Operating Systems:** Desktops, laptops, tablets, and their OS.
- **Self-Service Terminals:** ATMs, ticketing machines, check-in kiosks.
- **Smartphones & Telephones:** Accessibility-supporting devices.
- **Television Equipment:** Digital TV services and set-top boxes.
- **E-Readers:** Digital book reading devices.

## Accessibility Requirements

The EAA establishes general accessibility criteria for regulated products and services, including:[^eaa-annex-i]

- **Multimodal Access** – Information must be available via text, audio, visual channels.
- **Readable & Structured Content** – Clearly structured, legible text.
- **Accessible Websites & Applications** – Digital platforms must meet accessibility standards (perceivable, operable, understandable, robust).
- **Accessible Support Services** – Accessible communication options for help desks, call centers, relay services, and technical support.

The latter two points are particularly important for sign language access and digital inclusion.

[^eaa-annex-i]: European Union. [EAA Directive Art. 4 and Annex I](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#anx_I)

### Strong Foundation for Web & App Accessibility

The EAA requires digital content and applications to be accessible and compatible with assistive technologies. This creates opportunities for strengthening national regulations and industry standards, potentially expanding enforcement to WCAG Level AAA for essential services and including sign language support, captioning, and AI-driven accessibility tools.[^accessible-org]

### Support Service Accessibility: Enhancing User Interaction

Customer support services under the EAA must be accessible via assistive technologies. This encourages integrating sign language services, captioning, and text-based communication, significantly benefiting deaf and hard-of-hearing users.

## Recognition of Sign Language Under the EAA

The EAA does not mandate sign language but identifies areas where sign language is encouraged or expected:

- **Audiovisual Media Services** – Sign language interpretation for TV and streaming. _(Annex I, Section II, Point 2 & Annex II, Section IV, Lit. B)_
- **Interactive Computing Devices** – Video-capable devices must support sign language where feasible. _(Annex I, Section I, Point 2(iii) & Annex II, Section IV, Lit. III)_

## EAA and WCAG Compliance

While not explicitly mandating WCAG 2.1 AA, the EAA's accessibility requirements are aligned with EN 301 549, the harmonized EU standard referencing WCAG guidelines.[^en-301-549][^wcag-eaa-compliance]
Higher standards (e.g., WCAG AAA) are strongly encouraged in specific contexts:

- **Banking & Customer Services** – Accessible communication, with complexity levels not exceeding B2. _(Annex I, Section IV, Lit. E)_
- **Emergency Services (112 Calls)** – Support "Total Conversation" (video, text, voice). _(Annex I, Section V)_
- **Public Transport Information** – Accessible ticketing and travel information. _(Annex I, Section IV, Lit. C & D)_

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

National enforcement bodies impose fines and legal actions for non-compliance.[^eaa-article-30] Penalties vary by country, ranging from fines (e.g., Italy: 5% of annual turnover; Germany: €100,000) to operational restrictions.[^level-access-penalties][^inclusiveweb-penalties]
