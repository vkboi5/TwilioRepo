The "Specks of Light" podcast episode [161](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/curious-or/episodes/161---------------------e2uvv04) features Tal Meged.
Since the podcast is in Hebrew, we transcribed the episode, and asked ChatGPT to summarize it.

### **Introduction to Tal Meged & VSL**

The podcast opens with an introduction to **Tal Meged**, a key figure behind **VSL** (Visual Sign Language), a company dedicated to revolutionizing accessibility through **AI-driven sign language translation**. Meged shares his personal and professional journey, which began in the **Israeli Defense Forces** in **Unit 81**, where he worked on **advanced AI** systems. This military experience laid the groundwork for his later ventures in **business intelligence (BI)** and **data storage**.

Tal's journey also led him to **VSL**, a company that uses **deep learning** and **real-time 3D animation** to translate text into sign language. **VSL's mission** is to bridge the communication gap for the **deaf and hard-of-hearing communities**.

### **The Problem & VSL’s Mission**

**The Challenge:**  
One of the core problems that VSL addresses is the **lack of accessibility** for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Sign language, unlike spoken languages, is often **underserved by digital platforms**. This leads to difficulties in communication in many sectors like **public transportation, healthcare, and customer service**.

VSL's **mission** is to **make real-time sign language communication accessible** through **AI avatars**, making it possible for users to seamlessly interact with technology in their native sign language. They aim to create **hyper-realistic avatars** that convey not just signs but also **context, emotion, and intent** in the most **natural way possible**.

### **VSL’s Technological Approach**

VSL’s technology can be broken down into three **core components**:

#### **1. Natural Language Understanding (NLP & Glossing)**

The first step in VSL’s process is to translate **written or spoken text** into **structured sign language**. This is achieved using **natural language processing (NLP)**, where the system **interprets** the meaning of the text and **glosses it**—i.e., converts it into a format that reflects the grammar of sign language.

Key points discussed:

- Sign languages are not direct word-for-word translations of spoken languages, meaning that VSL's system needs to understand **context**.
- **Ambiguities and slang** are handled by VSL’s models, making sure that meanings, like "rock" (music vs. stone), are appropriately differentiated.

#### **2. Pose Estimation & Computer Vision**

Once the text is translated into a form that makes sense in sign language, the next step is to create the **visual avatar** that will deliver the translation. This is done using **pose estimation** models, such as **MediaPipe**, which track **human body movement** to generate gestures.

- **Key consideration:** VSL uses **custom-built datasets** to ensure the signs are as natural and accurate as possible, incorporating **facial expressions** and **hand positioning** that are essential for conveying accurate meaning in sign language.

#### **3. 3D Animation & Avatar Rendering**

The final step is to render the signs using **3D animation**. VSL uses **Unity**, a game engine, to create **real-time animated avatars**. These avatars are designed to be **lifelike**, moving fluidly and mimicking **human body language** rather than looking stiff or robotic.

- The use of **Unity** allows VSL to provide realistic avatar-based translations on **various platforms**.

This system results in **hyper-realistic, fluent sign language avatars** that can perform **real-time translations** of text into sign language, delivering **accurate communication**.

### **Target Customers & Market**

VSL primarily operates in a **B2B** (business-to-business) model, targeting enterprises that need **accessible communication solutions**. The podcast highlights some of VSL’s **primary customer sectors**:

#### **1. Transportation (Airlines & Airports)**

One of VSL's key markets is the **transportation sector**. Through its **VSL Aviation Sense** product, the company provides **real-time sign language translations** for things like **flight updates, announcements, and safety instructions**. This helps ensure **deaf or hard-of-hearing passengers** can navigate transportation hubs like airports without difficulty.

#### **2. Healthcare & Customer Service**

Another critical market for VSL is **healthcare**. Hospitals, insurance companies, and medical service providers use VSL to enhance accessibility, allowing **deaf patients** to interact with **digital platforms** and **customer service representatives**. For example, **chatbots** powered by VSL’s technology can help users schedule appointments or understand insurance policies, all via sign language.

#### **3. Public Sector**

Government and public sector organizations also form a significant portion of VSL’s customer base. In **public spaces** like train stations and airports, VSL’s avatars are used in **digital kiosks**, helping visitors interact with signage and emergency alerts in **sign language**.

#### **4. Entertainment & Education (Future Expansion)**

In the future, VSL is looking to expand into **entertainment and education**. This could include providing **real-time sign language translation** for platforms like **Netflix**, **YouTube**, and **educational lectures**.

### **Technological Pipeline & Future Developments**

While VSL’s current technology stack is impressive, there are **plans for further improvement** and **expansion**:

- **Real-Time Streaming**: VSL is working on **improving streaming capabilities** for **live events** such as conferences, meetings, and broadcasts, making sign language accessible for real-time viewers.

- **Multilingual Expansion**: Currently focused on **American Sign Language (ASL)**, VSL plans to expand to **other sign languages** such as **British Sign Language (BSL)**, **German Sign Language**, and **Brazilian Sign Language**.

- **Enterprise Integration**: VSL aims to integrate its technology with major platforms and applications, such as **enterprise software** and **web accessibility standards (WCAG AAA)**, to ensure **wider accessibility**.

### **Challenges in the Industry**

Despite VSL’s success, several **challenges** exist that hinder faster progress:

- **Data Scarcity**: One of the most pressing challenges is the **lack of large-scale datasets** for training AI models in sign language. This scarcity means VSL has to **build its own datasets** and continuously improve them.

- **Variety of Sign Languages**: There is no universal sign language, and over **200 different sign languages** exist across the globe. VSL’s system must therefore be adaptable to different linguistic systems, adding complexity to their solution.

- **Regulatory Hurdles**: While **captioning** is often required, **sign language translation** remains largely unregulated, especially in the **private sector**. Without clear mandates, widespread adoption of accessible technologies is slower.

- **Enterprise Sales**: Selling to large enterprises can be challenging, as decision-makers often need more than just **corporate social responsibility arguments**—they need to see **clear business value**.
